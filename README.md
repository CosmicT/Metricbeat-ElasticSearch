# Metricbeat-ElasticSearch
This Repository Contains the ElasticSearch Metricbeat Module Code Developed by the Owner of this Repository.

Metricbeat: Metric Datashippers for the ELK Stack.
	The ElasticSearch Metricbeat collects the ElasticSearch Application's Metrics and does Optimize as required and then ships the data to Elastic,Logstash,Kafka etc. as configured in the YAML file.
	This Metricbeat Module consists of subsets called Metricsets, which helps us to collect specific metrics of the application as required.
	Currently we have the Nodes Metricset to collect the ElasticSearch Application's Node's Metrics.
